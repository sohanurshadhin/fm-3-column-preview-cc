## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow using media query
- Used local stored fonts

### What I learned

Perfect Centering:

I used css flexbox for perfect centering the desired div. The properties are justify content & align items is suitable for a div perfect centering in screen. To be sure to uses fixed width in parent div or it doesn't works.

```html
<div class="content-box-wrapper">
  <div class="container">
```
```css
.content-box-wrapper {
  width: 1280px;
  height: 800px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```
